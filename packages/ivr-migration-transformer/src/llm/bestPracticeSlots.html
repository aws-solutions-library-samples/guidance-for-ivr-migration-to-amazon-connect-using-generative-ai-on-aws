# Best practices for creating Amazon Lex interaction models

Let’s look at some of the terminology we use frequently in this post:

* **Utterance** – The phrase the user says to your live bot.
* **Sample utterance** – Some examples of what users might say. These are attached to intents and used to train the bot.
* **Intent** – This represents what the user meant and should be clearly connected to a response or an action from the
bot. For instance, an intent that responds to a user saying hello, or an intent that can respond and take action if a
user wants to order a coffee. A bot has one or more intents that utterances can be mapped to.
* **Slot** – A parameter that can capture specific types of information from the utterance (for example, the time of an
appointment or the customer’s name). Slots are attached to intents.
* **Slot value** – Either examples of what the slot should capture, or a specific list of values for a slot (for
example, _large_, _medium_, and _small_ as values for a slot for coffee sizes).

The best practices listed in the following sections can support you in building a bot that will give your customers a
great user experience and work well for your use case.

## Creating slots

We touched on some good practices involving slots in the previous section, but let’s look at some more specific best
practices for slots.

### 1. Use short noun or adjective phrases for slots

Slots represent something that can be captured definitively as a parameter, like the size of the coffee you want to
order, or the airport you’re flying to. Consider the following:

* Use nouns or short adjectives for your slot values. Don’t use slots for things like carrier phrases (“_how do I_” or
“_what could I_”) because this will reduce the ability of Amazon Lex to generalize your utterances. Try to keep slots
for values you need to capture to fulfil your intent.
* Keep slots generally to one or two words.

### 2. Prefer slots over explicit values

You can use slots to generalize the phrases you’re using, but we need to stick to the recommendations we just reviewed
as well. To make our slot values as easy to identify as possible, we never use values included in the slot directly in
sample utterances. Keep in mind the following tips:

* **Don’t** explicitly include values that could be slots in the sample utterances. For example:

`**OrderFlowers**`
`I want to buy **roses**`
`I want to buy **lilies**`
`I would love to order some **orchids**`
`I would love to order some **roses**`

* **Do** use slots to reduce repetition. For example:

`**OrderFlowers**`
`I want to buy {flowers}`
`I would love to order some {flowers}`

`**flowers**`
`roses`
`lilies`
`orchids`

* **Don’t** mix slots and real values in the sample utterances. For example:

`**OrderFlowers**`
`I want to buy {flowers}`
`I want to buy **lilies**`
`I would love to order some {flowers}`

`**flowers**`
`roses`
`lilies`
`orchids`

* **Don’t** have intents with only slots in the sample utterances if the slot types are `AlphaNumeric`, `Number`,
`Date`, `GRXML`, are very broad custom slots, or include abbreviations. Instead, expand the sample utterances by adding
conversational phrases that include the slot to the sample utterances.

### 3. Keep your slot values coherent

The bot has to decide whether to match a slot based only on what it can learn from the values we have entered. If there
is a lot of similarity or overlap within slots in the same intent, this can cause challenges with the right slot being
matched.

* **Don’t** have slots with overlapping values in the same intent. Try to combine them instead. For example:

`**pets**`
`cat`
`dog`
`goldfish`

`**animals**`
`horse`
`cat`
`dog`

### 4. Consider how the words will be transcribed

Amazon Lex uses automated speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe speech. This means that all inputs to your Amazon Lex
interaction model are processed as text, even when using a voice bot. We need to remember that a transcription may vary
from how users might type the same thing. Consider the following:

* Enter acronyms, or other words whose letters should be pronounced individually, as single letters separated by a
period and a space. This will more closely match how it will be transcribed. For example:

`A. T. M.`
`A. W. S.`
`P. A.`

* Review the audio and transcriptions on a regular basis, so you can adjust your sample utterances or slot types. To do
this, turn on conversation logs, and enable both text and audio logs, whenever possible.

### 9\. Use the right options available for your slots

Many different types of slots and options are available, and using the best options for each of our slots can help the
recognition of those slot values. We always want to take the time to understand the options before deciding on how to
design our slots:

* Use the restrict option to limit slots to a closed set of values. You can define synonyms for each value. This could
be, for instance, the menu items in your restaurant.
* Use the expand option when you want to be able to identify more than just the sample values you provide (for example,
Name).
* Turn obfuscation on for slots that are collecting sensitive data to prevent the data from being logged.
* Use [runtime hints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/using-hints.html) to improve slot recognition when you
can narrow down the potential options at runtime. Choosing one slot might narrow down the options for another; for
example, a particular type of furniture may not have all color options.
* Use [spelling styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/using-spelling.html) to capture uncommon words or
words with variations in spellings such as names.

### 5. Use custom vocabulary for specialist domains

In most cases, a [custom vocabulary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/vocab.html) is not required, but can be
helpful if your users will use specialist words not common in everyday language. In this case, adding one can be helpful
in making sure that your transcriptions are accurate. Keep the following in mind:

* **Do** use a custom vocabulary to add words that aren’t readily recognized by Amazon Lex in voice-based conversations.
This improves the speech-to-text transcription and overall customer experience.
* **Don’t** use short or common words like “on,” “it,” “to,” “yes,” or “no” in a custom vocabulary.
* **Do** decide how much weight to give a word based on how often the word isn’t recognized in the transcription and how
rare the word is in the input. Words that are difficult to pronounce require a higher weight. Use a representative test
set to determine if a weight is appropriate. You can collect an audio test set by turning on audio logging in
conversation logs.
* **Do** use custom slot types for lists of catalog values or entities such as product names or mutual funds.

### 6. GRXML slots need a strict grammar

When migrating to Amazon Lex from a service that may already have grammars in place (such as traditional automatic
speech recognition engines), it is possible to reuse [GRXML
grammars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/building-srgs.html) during the new bot design process. However,
when creating a completely new Amazon Lex bot, we recommend first checking if other slot types might meet your needs
before using GRXML. Consider the following:

* **Do** use GRXML slots only for spoken input, and not text-based interactions.
* **Don’t** add the carrier phrases for the GRXML slots in the GRXML file (grammar) itself.
* **Do** put carrier phrases into the slot sample utterances, such as I live in {zipCode} or {zipCode} is my zip code.
* **Do** author the grammar to only capture correct slot values. For example, to capture a five-digit US ZIP code, you
should only accept values that are exactly five digits.

### 7. Make sure the sample utterances reference the slot name and not type

Example:

For slot "eArrivalCity" with type "ArrivalCityType"

The sample utterances will be:
- I want to go to {eArrivalCity}
- My destination is {eArrivalCity}

### 8. Make sure your sample utterances include context words

Bad Example:

- {eArrivalCity}

Good Example:
- My destination is {eArrivalCity}
- I want to fly to {eArrivalCity}
- I'm traveling to {eArrivalCity}
