# IVR Migration Schemas

All json schema are stored within `/src/schemas`.

The [compiler.ts](src/compiler.ts) reads all schemas from this location, generates Typescript models, and saves to `src/models`. To run the compiler execute `bun run compiler`.

> DO NOT MANUALLY UPDATE THE MODELS! As these are autogenerated, update the relevant json schema, then run the compiler.
